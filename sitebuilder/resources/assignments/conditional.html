All problems are from Feller.

  <li>Ten fair dice were thrown. Given that at least one of them produced <strong>one</strong>, what is the probability that two or more dice produced <strong>one</strong>.</li>
  <li>In a bolt factory machines A, B, C manufacture 25, 35 and 40 percent of the total, respectively. Of their output 5, 4 and 2 per cent (respectively) are defective bolts. A bolt is drawn at random from the produce and is found defective. What are the probabilities that it was manufactured by machines A, B and C? </li>
  <li>A (fair) die is thrown as long as necessary for <strong>one</strong> to turn up.
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Assuming that <strong>one</strong> does not turn up at the first throw, what is the probability that more than three throws will be necessary.</li>
      <li>Suppose that the number, $n$, of throws is even. What is the probability that $n=2$?</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Die A has four red and two white faces, whereas die B has two red and four white faces. A coin is flipped <em>once</em>. If it falls head, die A is chosen and if it falls tail die B is chosen. The chosen die is thrown repeatedly.
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Show that the probability of red at any throw is $1/2$. </li>
      <li>If the first two throws result in red, what is the probability of red in the third throw? </li>
      <li>If red turns up at the first $n$ throws, what is the probability that die A is being used? </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Let the probability that a family has exactly $n$ children be $p_n=\alpha p^n$ when $n\geq 1$ and $p_0 = 1 - \alpha p(1 + p + p^2 + \dots)$ for $n=0$. Suppose that all sex distributions of children have the same probability. Show that for $k\geq 1$ the probability that a family has exactly $k$ boys is $2\alpha p^k/(2 - p)^{k+1}$. </li>
</ol>
