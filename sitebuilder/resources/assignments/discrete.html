  <h4>
    A fair coin is tossed until the two consecutive tosses have the same result.
  </h4>
  <li> Describe the sample space $\Omega$.</li>
  <li> Give a formula for the function $p:\Omega \to \mathbb{R}$ giving the probabilities of outcomes.</li>
  <li> Show that $(\Omega, p)$ is a discrete probability space, in particular $\sum_{\omega\in\Omega}p(\omega) = 1.$</li>
  <li> In the above, what is the probability that the number of tosses is at most $6$?</li>
  <li> What is the probability that the number of tosses is even?</li>
  <h4> A nine digit number is formed by arranging the digits $1$ to $9$ in a random order, with equal probability for each permutation. Let $A_i$ be the event that the $i$th digit is $i$ (we say the $i$th digit is in the correct place) and $A$ the event that <em>some</em> digit is in the correct place. </h4>
  <li> By relating $A$ to the events $A_i$ and obtain an <em>upper bound</em> on $P(A)$. Is this a useful bound?</li>
  <li> Compute $P(A_i\cap A_j)$ and obtain a <em>lower bound</em> on $P(A)$ using this. Why do you think (intuitively) that this bound is not very good, i.e., close to the upper bound? </li>
